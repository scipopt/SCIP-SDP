/**@file   branch_cs.h
 * @ingroup BRANCHINGRULES
 * @brief  special branching rule for compressed sensing problems in SCIPSDP
 * @author Tristan Gally
 *
 * This branching rule is used for a MISDP to compute exact left- and right-hand-side-restricted-isometry-constants. The idea is, that if we branch on a binary
 * variable, the objective of the problem with this binary variable set to one will most likely change only minimally, while we can compute a good approximation
 * on the solution (and therefore the objective) of the problem where it is set to zero. In this case, because of the Trace-Constraint, if we set a binary
 * variable to zero, thereby eliminating it, the whole column and row will be set to zero (all variables coupled with it), but because this decreases the trace
 * by the value of the corresponding diagonal entry (the only continuous variable, that is only coupled with this binary variable), we have to multiply all
 * other entries of the matrix by 1-(1/y), where y is the corresponding diagonal entry.
