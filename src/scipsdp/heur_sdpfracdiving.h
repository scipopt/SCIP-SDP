/**@file   heur_sdpfracdiving.h

 * @brief  SDP diving heuristic that chooses fixings w.r.t. the fractionalities
 * @author Marc Pfetsch
 *
 * Diving heuristic: Iteratively fixes some fractional variable and resolves the SDP-relaxation, thereby simulating a
 * depth-first-search in the tree. Fractional Diving chooses the variable with the highest fractionality and rounds it to the
 * nearest integer. One-level backtracking is applied: If the SDP gets infeasible, the last fixing is undone, and the
 * opposite fixing is tried. If this is infeasible, too, the procedure aborts.
