 *
 * Randomized Rounding heuristic for SDPs. Takes the solution of the SDP-relaxation and randomly rounds all integer
 * variables. They are rounded up with probability equal to the fractional part and down otherwise. If the SDP includes
 * continuous variables, the remaining SDP after the fixings is solved again. This process is repeated up to the number
 * of rounds.
