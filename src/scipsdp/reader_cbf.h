 * @author Tristan Gally
 * @author Henrik A. Friberg
 *
 * This reader allows to parse and write CBF files with mixed-integer semidefinite programs in dual form.
 * Writing is supported for original programs consisting of only linear and semidefinite constraints. Parsing is supported
 * for instances consisting of only scalar variables and linear and semidefinite constraints.
