       *
       *  The method is called in the node processing loop. It solves the current subproblem's relaxation.
       *  Like the LP relaxation, the relaxator should only operate on COLUMN variables.
       *
       *  possible return values for *result (if more than one applies, the first in the list should be used):
       *  - SCIP_CUTOFF     : the node is infeasible in the variable's bounds and can be cut off
       *  - SCIP_CONSADDED  : an additional constraint was generated, and the relaxator should not be called again on the
       *                      same relaxation
       *  - SCIP_REDUCEDDOM : a variable's domain was reduced, and the relaxator should not be called again on the same
       *                      relaxation
       *  - SCIP_SEPARATED  : a cutting plane was generated, and the relaxator should not be called again on the same
       *                      relaxation
       *  - SCIP_SUCCESS    : the relaxator solved the relaxation and should not be called again on the same relaxation
       *  - SCIP_SUSPENDED  : the relaxator interrupted its solving process to wait for additional input (e.g. cutting
       *                      planes); however, it is able to continue the solving in order to improve the dual bound
       *  - SCIP_DIDNOTRUN  : the relaxator was skipped
