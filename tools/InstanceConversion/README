This folder contains scripts to convert dat-s instances to other formats to compare SCIP-SDP with other solvers:

- spdainttoyalmip.m: This MATLAB script loads a .dat-s file with integrality constraints and inserts it into YALMIP. By commenting in line 67 and commenting out line 68 one can use CUTSDP instead of BNB. Note that one needs to add some lines within YALMIP to get correct output of branch-and-bound nodes (for version R20180926 "global yalmiptestnnodes // yalmiptestnnodes = solved_nodes;" in lines 861/862 of modules/global/bnb.m), although this functionality was also added for newer YALMIP version and the code here could be changed accordingly.
- yalmiptestrun.m: For each instance in the given file (for an example see SCIPSDPpaper_YalmipTestrun.test) calls sdpainttoyalmip.m to solve the instance with YALMIP and writes results and statistics into INPUTFILE.results . Note that the paths to the CPLEX, MOSEK, Sedumi (since Sedumi scripts are used in sdpainttoyalmip.m to convert dat-s to MATLAB) and YALMIP should be edited in lines 8 to 11. 
- ConicBenchmarkUtilities.jl-master is a julia project by Miles Lubin to read cbf-files into Convex.jl including Pajarito. The file test/SCIPSDPpajaritoTestrunCBF.jl was added to run automatic tests with a version of Pajarito with tolerances and settings adjusted to match SCIP-SDP. It reads all instances in INPUTFILE.test (for an example see SCIPSDPpaper_pajaritoTestrun.test), solves them using Pajarito and writes results and statistics into INPUTFILE.test.pajaritoresults. The path to the input file needs to be edited in line 21, additional Pajarito options can be given in line 30. To start the script, just run test/SCIPSDPpajaritoTestrunCBF.jl in Julia.
- SdpaToConvex.jl was an old attempt to read dat-s files into Convex.jl and Pajarito, but as long as a cbf-file exists, ConicBenchmarkUtilities should be preferred
- convertDatsCbf.py is a python script to convert .dat-s files to .cbf files by first reading them into SCIP-SDP and then writing the problem via the cbf-reader. As an input it expects a file listing the location of dat-s files with full path, which will all be converted to the conic benchmark format.
