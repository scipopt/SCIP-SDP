This folder contains scripts to produce Tables and Plots from SCIP-SDP (and other MISDP solver) testruns:

- extractStatDrawPerfGraph.py: This is called with a tex-file is first argument and a list of .out-files of SCIP-SDP testruns as remaining arguments and compiles Tables and Plots for the results and writes them into the tex-File given as the first argument (note: the file will be overwritten!) Examples for calls are given in the file. Additional options can be set via parameter given in the python script after the examples, in particular different columns can be chosen, different tables can be selected/unselected, the maximum number of instances needs to be given, a partition of the test set into different sets can be given to compile distinct tables for each set and names and captions can be chosen.
- extractStatDrawPerfGraph_roundingprob.py: This is a particular version used for compiling statistics of the number of successes for the roundingproblems used in warmstarting.
- extractStatDrawPerfGraph_ug.py: Particular version for comparing SCIP-SDP and UG. In addition to the tex-file and a SCIP-SDP testrun it gets paths to folders including the UG-outfiles (in particular the "_LC0-T.status" files)
- readAndPrintSlater_absolute.py: Can be used to produce tables with statistics regarding to the Slater condition. Needs SCIP-SDP testrun files with Slater checking and output enabled and with absolute (instead of percentaged) values for the Slater statistics
- compareScriptSCIPSDP_YALMIP_Pajarito_SCIPSDPLP.py: Takes a tex-file to write into, a SCIP-SDP testrun out-file, a SCIP-SDP LP-approx testrun out-file, a yalmip resultsfile as written by the SCIP-SDP-YALMIP-testrun-script, a YALMIP-CUTSDP resultsfile of the same script, and a Pajarito outfile of the corresponding script and compiles and writes tables to compare the different solvers
