relaxing/SDP/freq

frequency for calling SDP relaxation handler (-1: never, 0: only in root node), together with lp/solvefreq this can be used to decide between solving SDP relaxations and solving LPs with eigenvalue cuts

relaxing/SDP/priority

priority of SDP relaxation handler

relaxing/SDP/advanced/sdpsolverepsilon

stopping criterion on duality gap for sdp-solver

relaxing/SDP/advanced/sdpsolverfeastol

feasibility tolerance for sdp-solver

branching/sdpinfobjective/maxbounddist
branching/sdpinfobjective/maxdepth
branching/sdpinfobjective/priority

set maxbounddist (maximal relative distance from current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying branching rule (0.0: only on current best node, 1.0: on all nodes)), maxdepth (maximal depth level, up to which branching rule <sdpinfobjective> should be used (-1 for no limit)) and priority for branching on the branching candidate with highest 
product of integer-infeasibility and absolute objective value

branching/sdpmostfrac/maxbounddist
branching/sdpmostfrac/maxdepth
branching/sdpmostfrac/priority

set maxbounddist (maximal relative distance from current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying branching rule (0.0: only on current best node, 1.0: on all nodes)), maxdepth (maximal depth level, up to which branching rule <sdpinfobjective> should be used (-1 for no limit)) and priority for branching on the branching candidate with highest fractional value

branching/sdpmostinf/maxbounddist
branching/sdpmostinf/maxdepth
branching/sdpmostinf/priority

set maxbounddist (maximal relative distance from current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying branching rule (0.0: only on current best node, 1.0: on all nodes)), maxdepth (maximal depth level, up to which branching rule <sdpinfobjective> should be used (-1 for no limit)) and priority for branching on the branching candidate with highest integer-infeasibility (meaning that an integer variable with value n.5 is preferred over all others)

branching/sdpobjective/maxbounddist
branching/sdpobjective/maxdepth
branching/sdpobjective/priority

set maxbounddist (maximal relative distance from current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying branching rule (0.0: only on current best node, 1.0: on all nodes)), maxdepth (maximal depth level, up to which branching rule <sdpinfobjective> should be used (-1 for no limit)) and priority for branching on the branching candidate with highest absolute objective

constraints/SDP/propfreq
constraints/SDP/sepafreq

propagating and separating frequency for the SDP constraint handler
