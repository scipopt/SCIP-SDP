the following parameters (with these default values) that were added might be useful:

relaxing/SDPRelax/freq=1 // set this to -1 and lp/solvefreq to 1 to solve LP relaxations and add eigenvector cuts
propagating/sdpredcost/freq = 1 // set this to -1 to disable reduced cost fixing for SDPs
relaxing/SDPRelax/sdpsolverepsilon=0.001 // sets the bound for the duality gap in the SDP-Solver and also the difference that is allowed when fixing variables before inserting into the SDP-solver
relaxing/SDPRelax/sdpsolverfeastol=0.000001 // a matrix is considered positive semidefinite if the smallest eigenvalue is bigger than -sdpsolverfeastol
