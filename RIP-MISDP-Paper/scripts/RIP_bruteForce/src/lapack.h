/**@file   lapack.h
 * @brief  interface methods for eigenvector computation and matrix multiplication using different versions of LAPACK and BLAS
 * @author Tristan Gally
 *
 * This file is used to call the LAPACK routine DSYEVR (double-symmetric-eigenvector computation) and the
 * BLAS routine DGEMV (double-general-matrix-vector multiplication). It is needed because different SDP-solvers
 * need different BLAS/LAPACK-versions with different data types (for example long long int for
 * Openblas/SDPA vs. int for ATLAS/DSDP).
