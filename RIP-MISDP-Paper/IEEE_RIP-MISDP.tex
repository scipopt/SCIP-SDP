  One of the fundamental tasks in compressed sensing is finding the
  sparsest solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations. It is
  well known that although this problem is \NP-hard, under certain
  conditions it can be solved by using a linear program which minimizes the
  1-norm. The restricted isometry property has been one of the key
  conditions in this context. However, computing the best constants for
  this condition is itself \NP-hard. In this paper we propose a
  mixed-integer semidefinite programming approach for computing these
  optimal constants. This also subsumes sparse principal component
  analysis. Computational results with this approach allow to evaluate
  ealier SDP relaxations and show that their quality is limited.

\section{Introduction}



\IEEEPARstart{F}{inding} a sparsest solution of an underdetermined system of linear
equations is one key problem in compressed sensing and has been
thoroughly investigated in recent years. Given a matrix $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ with $m \ n$ and 
right-hand side $b \in \R^m$, one core problem is to compute
\begin{align}\label{l0min}
 \min \quad & \Norm{x}{0} \tag{$P_0$}\\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & Ax = b, \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\Norm{x}{0}$ denotes the number of nonzero components of~$x$. This
problem is \NP-hard, see Garey and
Johnson~\cite{GareyJohnson}. One key observation in compressed sensing is
that a solution of~\eqref{l0min} can be found by solving the following
convex optimization problem if certain conditions are fulfilled:
\begin{align}\label{l1min}
 \min \quad & \Norm{x}{1} \tag{$P_1$}\\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & Ax = b. \nonumber
\end{align}
In fact, this so-called \emph{basis pursuit} problem can be reformulated as
a linear program (LP) and efficient specialized solution algorithms are
available both in theory and practice: as an extremely selected list
consider the articles~\cite{BecBC11,CheDS99,OsbPT00,vdBF08}. For more
information we refer the reader to~\cite{FouR13} and the practical
comparison in~\cite{LorPT15}.

\section{The Restriced Isometry Property}
\label{sec:RIP}


Several conditions in compressed sensing imply that a solution
of~\eqref{l0min} can be \emph{recovered} by solving \eqref{l1min}, in which
case one speaks of $\ell_0$-$\ell_1$-\emph{equivalence}. First results in
this direction were established by Chen, Donoho, and
Saunders~\cite{CheDS99} and Donoho and Huo~\cite{DH01}, with many articles
following. We therefore refer the reader to the excellent book by Foucart
and Rauhut~\cite{FouR13} for further information.

One important condition is the \emph{restricted isometry property} (RIP),
which was first introduced by Cand\`es and Tao~\cite{CT05}. 

\begin{definition}\label{ripdef}
  The \emph{restricted isometry property} (RIP) of order~$k$ holds for a
  matrix $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ with constant~$\delta \geq 0$, if
  \begin{equation}\label{rip}
    (1 - \delta) \Norm{x}{2}^2 \leq \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \leq (1+\delta) \Norm{x}{2}^2
  \end{equation}
  for all $x \in \Sigma_k \define \{x \in \R^n \suchthat \Norm{x}{0} \leq k\}$.
\end{definition}

Since the following results depend on the constant $\delta$ in (\ref{rip}) being
small enough, we are generally interested in the smallest constant satisfying
(\ref{rip}).

\begin{definition}\label{ricdef}
For a matrix $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ and order~$k$, the smallest constant in 
(\ref{rip}),
\begin{equation}\label{ric}
 \begin{aligned}
  \delta_k \define \argmin_{\delta \geq 0} \{&(1 - \delta) \Norm{x}{2}^2 \leq \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \leq (1+\delta) \Norm{x}{2}^2 ,\\
  & \text{ for all }x \in \Sigma_k\},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is called \emph{restricted isometry constant} (RIC).
\end{definition}

If the restricted isometry property holds for a sufficiently small
restricted isometry constant, then the optimal solutions of~\eqref{l0min}
and~\eqref{l1min} coincide.  The best-known result of this type is probably
the following:
 
\begin{theorem}[Cand\'es~\cite{Can08}]\label{RIPsqrt2}
  Let $A$ satisfy $\delta_{2k} < \sqrt{2}-1 \approx 0.4142$. If there
  exists $\tilde{x} \in \R^n$ with $\Norm{\tilde{x}}{0} \leq k$ such that
  $A\tilde{x} = b$, then the optimal solutions of~\eqref{l0min}
  and~\eqref{l1min} coincide.
\end{theorem}

Many results similar to Theorem~\ref{RIPsqrt2} exist: For
example, Foucart~\cite{fou10} relaxed the condition to $\delta_{2k} <
0.4652$ and Foucart and Rauhut~\cite{FouR13} to $\delta_{2k} < 0.6246$.
Moreover, Cai et al.~\cite{CWX10} showed the condition $\delta_k <
0.307$ for Theorem~\ref{RIPsqrt2} to hold. 

For this paper, it is useful to take an asymmetric viewpoint and
distinguish between the lower and upper bounds in~\eqref{rip}, as proposed
by Foucart and Lai~\cite{FL09}:

\begin{definition}\label{asymRIPdef}
 The \emph{lower} and \emph{upper restricted isometry constant} are defined as
 \begin{align}
   \alpha_k & \define \argmax_{\alpha \geq 0}\; \{ \alpha^2 \Norm{x}{2}^2
   \leq \Norm{Ax}{2}^2,\; \text{ for all }x \in \Sigma_k\}, \label{lowerRIP}\\
   \beta_k & \define \argmin_{\beta \geq 0}\; \{ \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \leq \beta^2
   \Norm{x}{2}^2,\; \text{ for all }x \in \Sigma_k\},\label{upperRIP}
 \end{align}
 respectively. The \emph{restricted isometry ratio} (RIR) is
 defined as $\gamma_k \define \beta_k^2 / \alpha_k^2$ for $\alpha_k \neq 0$.
\end{definition}

%
Definition~\ref{asymRIPdef} is a generalization of Definition~\ref{ripdef}
in the following sense: if the matrix~$A$ satisfies the RIP of order $k$
with RIC $\delta_k$, then it has a RIR of at most $(1 + \delta_k) / (1 -
\delta_k)$. Conversely, if $A$ has lower/upper RICs $\alpha_k$ and
$\beta_k$, respectively, then this implies a restricted isometry constant
of $\delta_k = \max \{1 - \alpha_k^2,\; \beta_k^2 - 1\}$ in~\eqref{rip}.
So $A$ has a small RIC if and only if it has a large lower and a small upper 
RIC. But since in~\eqref{rip} usually only one of the two inequalities will 
be sharp, the asymmetric version yields more information about~$A$.

For the asmmetric version of the RIP in Definition~\ref{asymRIPdef}, we
can again show $\ell_0$-$\ell_1$-equivalence:

\begin{theorem}[Foucart and Lai~\cite{FL09}]\label{asymRIPtheorem}
  Let $A$ satisfy $\gamma_{2k} \leq 4 \sqrt{2} - 3 \approx 2.6569$. If
  there exists $\tilde{x} \in \R^n$ with $\Norm{\tilde{x}}{0} \leq k$ such
  that $A\tilde{x} = b$, then the optimal solutions of~\eqref{l0min}
  and~\eqref{l1min} coincide.
\end{theorem}

One advantage
of Definition~\ref{asymRIPdef} and Theorem~\ref{asymRIPtheorem} is that they
are invariant under scaling of $Ax = b$. The condition of
Theorem~\ref{RIPsqrt2} holding for~$A x = b$ does not imply the same 
for the scaled equation
$\lambda Ax = \lambda b$. In Definition \ref{asymRIPdef}, however, we can
use $\tilde{\alpha}_k = \lambda \alpha_k$, $\tilde{\beta}_k = \lambda
\beta_k$, and therefore $\tilde{\gamma}_k = \lambda^2 \alpha_k^2 /
\lambda^2 \beta_k^2 = \gamma_k$.

Furthermore, the recovery results given in this section can also be derived 
for the \emph{denoising} case, where instead of~\eqref{l0min} one considers
\begin{align}\label{l0minDenoising}
  \min \quad & \Norm{x}{0} \tag{$P_0^\delta$}\\
  \text{s.t.} \quad & \Norm{Ax - b}{2} \leq \delta, \nonumber
\end{align}
for some $\delta \geq 0$; the $\ell_1$-problem~\eqref{l1min} is changed
similarly. For more details we refer the reader to~\cite{FouR13}.


\subsection{Literature Overview and Contribution of this Work}

There are several types of matrices~$A$ for which it is possible
to show analytically that the RIP holds, for instance random
matrices, see, e.g., Baraniuk et al.~\cite{BDDW08}.
Still, a big drawback of the RIP is that computing the restricted isometry
constants for a given matrix~$A$ and~$k$ is NP-hard, see~\cite{PT14}. 
On the other hand, d'Aspremont et al.~\cite{Asp08,Asp07} proposed several
semidefinite relaxations to compute upper bounds on the restricted isometry
constants. Note that small upper bounds suffice to guarantee
$\ell_0$-$\ell_1$-equivalence between~\eqref{l0min} and~\eqref{l1min}, but
there exist cases in which the bounds are too weak to give a guarantee.

The relaxations in \cite{Asp08,Asp07} were originally derived for the deeply
connected problem of sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). Principal
component analysis (PCA) is about finding orthogonal directions maximizing the 
variance given in matrix $A$. SPCA tries to fix the problem that the components
of PCA usually consist of small contributions of all axes, which make the results
hard to interpret, by enforcing sparsity on the components. SPCA was
originally proposed by Zuo et al. in \cite{SPCA}, where a penalty term was added 
to the objective. Other authors like Moghaddam et al. in \cite{sbSPCA} also proposed 
computing a sparse maximal eigenvalue for SPCA, like it is done for the RIP.

The goal of this paper is to compute optimal restricted isometry constants
via a mixed integer semidefinite program (MISDP). To this end, we will
introduce an MISDP with a rank-1 constraint. In order to
utilize this MISDP, we will show that the rank constraint can be relaxed
without changing the optimal value. It will turn out that
the resulting problems are quite hard to solve, even for matrices of
smaller size. However, the results allow an evaluation of the SDP
relaxations of d'Aspremont et al. Depending on the input matrices, these
bounds can be quite tight or weak. This complements the theoretical
approximation guarantees developed by d'Aspremont et
al. in~\cite{AspBG14}.

In the following, we will start by reviewing the SDP-relaxations of~\cite{Asp08}
and~\cite{Asp07} in Section~\ref{sec:SDPrelax}.
Afterwards, we will construct a mixed integer semidefinite
programm and show that it produces exact restricted isometry constants in
Section~\ref{sec:MISDP}. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:numerical_results},
we present numerical results and comparisons with the SDP relaxations in
\cite{Asp08} and \cite{Asp07}.


\section{SDP Relaxations}
\label{sec:SDPrelax}

In this section, we will introduce two known SDP relaxations to compute an upper bound on the restricted isometry constant $\delta_k$ in (\ref{rip}), as they have some ideas in common with the mixed integer semidefinite program we want to 
propose and will also be checked against in the section on numerical results. The idea of these two relaxations as well as the MISDP in the next section is that the optimal constant $\alpha_k^2$ in (\ref{lowerRIP}) can be computed
by the non-convex quadratic optimization problem
\begin{align}\label{QP}
 \min \quad & \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1 \tag{QP} \\
 & \Norm{x}{0} \leq k. \nonumber
\end{align}
The corresponding maximization problem allows to compute $\beta_k^2$. In \cite{Asp07} the non-convex quadratic equality constraint $\Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1$ is tackled by the technique of semidefinite lifting first introduced in \cite{GW95} 
for the max-cut problem. The idea is to use a new matrix variable $X=xx\T$ for the quadratic terms, where the condition $X=xx\T$ is then enforced by the equivalent constraints $X \succeq 0$ and $\Rk(X) = 1$, where 
$X \succeq 0$ means that $X$ is symmetric (shortly written \mbox{$X \in S_n$}) and positive semidefinite. The objective and the normalization-constraint can then be expressed in $X$ as  $\Norm{Ax}{2}^2 = x\T A\T Ax =
\Tr(A\T A X)$ and $\Norm{x}{2}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = \Tr(X)$. In the
next step the inequality $\Norm{x}{0} \leq k$ is then substituted by the coarser constraint $\ones\T
\abs{X} \ones \leq k$, which follows from the fact that $\ones\T\abs{X} \ones = \Norm{\vect(X)}{1}\leq \sqrt{\Norm{\vect(X)}{0}} \Norm{\vect(X)}{2}$ and $\Norm{\vect(X)}{0}=\Norm{x}{0}^2$ in the rank 1 case, where $\vect(X)$ is a vector
in $\R^{n^2}$ consisting of all entries of $X$. 
Relaxing the non-convex Rank-constraint finally leads to the following relaxation:
\begin{align}\label{Asp07}
 \min \quad & \Tr(A\T A X) \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Tr(X) = 1 \nonumber \\
 & \ones\T \abs{X} \ones \leq k \tag{A1} \\
 & X \succeq 0. \nonumber
\end{align}

Another SDP relaxation was proposed in \cite{Asp08}. There the problem
\begin{equation}\label{phi}
 \phi(\rho) = \max_{\Norm{x}{2} \leq 1} x\T \Sigma x - \rho \Norm{x}{0},
\end{equation}
originally stemming from sparse principal component analysis, is tackled for a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix $\Sigma$. For
$\Sigma = A\T A$ we can use this to compute an upper bound on $\beta_k$ via Lagrangian Relaxation as
\begin{equation*}
 \begin{aligned}
  \beta_k^2 & = \max_{\|x\|_2 \leq 1, \|x\|_0 \leq k} x^TA^TAx \\
	    & \leq \inf_{\rho \geq 0} \max_{\|x\|_2\leq 1} x^TA^TAx - \rho (\|x\|_0-k) \\
	    & = \inf_{\rho \geq 0} \phi(\rho) + \rho k.
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

As one way to solve (\ref{phi}) the semidefinite lifting technique is used again to compute an upper bound on $\phi$ via
\begin{align}\label{Asp08}
 \max \quad & \sum_{i=1}^n\Tr(P_iB_i) \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Tr(X) = 1 \nonumber \\
 & X \succeq 0 \tag{A2-Primal} \\
 & X \succeq P_i \succeq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, ..., n, \nonumber
\end{align}
for $B_i = b_ib_i\T - \rho I,$ where $b_i$ is the $i$-th column of a squareroot of $\Sigma$, for details see \cite{Asp08}. The corresponding dual problem can then be written as 
\begin{align}\label{Asp08Dual}
  \min \quad & \lambda_{\max}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \right) \nonumber \\
  \text{s.t.} \quad & Y_i \succeq B_i \quad \forall i \leq n \tag{A2-Dual} \\
  & Y_i \succeq 0 \quad \ \ \text{for } i = 1, ..., n, \nonumber
\end{align}
which only has half as many variables as (\ref{Asp08}) and one less linear and semidefinite constraint. Then (\ref{Asp08Dual}) can be solved for non-negative $\rho$, which should be smaller than $\Sigma_{11}$, because otherwise the
optimal solution for (\ref{phi}) will always be $x=0$. 

As mentioned in \cite{Asp08}, a lower bound for $\alpha_k$ can be computed via
\begin{equation*}
 \alpha_k^2 \geq \sup_{\rho \geq 0} \psi(\rho) - \rho k,
\end{equation*}
with 
\begin{equation*}
 \psi(\rho) = \min_{\Norm{x}{2} \leq 1} x\T \Sigma x + \rho \Norm{x}{0}.
\end{equation*}
In this case problem (\ref{Asp08}) or equivalently (\ref{Asp08Dual}) has to be solved for $\Sigma = M I - A\T A$, where $M$ has to be big enough to make $\Sigma$ positive semidefinite again. If $\bar{\Psi}$ is the corresponding optimal solution, this implies
a lower bound on $\alpha_k$ in
\begin{equation*}
 \alpha_k^2 \geq \sup_{\rho \geq 0} (M - \bar{\Psi}) - \rho k.
\end{equation*}

In \cite{AspBG14} explicit bounds on the quality of the semidefinite relaxation where derived using randomization arguments.

\section{An MISDP for the Restricted Isometry Property}
\label{sec:MISDP}

In this section we want to compute the optimal constants $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ in (\ref{lowerRIP}) and (\ref{upperRIP}) using mixed integer semidefinite programming. We will again start with the non-convex quadratic problem
\begin{align}\label{QP2}
 \min \quad & \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1 \tag{QP} \\
 & \Norm{x}{0} \leq k. \nonumber
\end{align}
For the non-convex quadratic equality constraint $\Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1$ we will
again use semidefinite lifting, introducing the new variable $X=xx\T$ like in the last section. 
The cardinality-constraint in (\ref{QP}) can equivalently be written using binary variables $z_i$ as $-z_i \leq x_i \leq z_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n z_i \leq k$. We can thus rewrite (\ref{QP}) equivalently as
% In this section we want to compute the optimal constants $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ in (\ref{asymRIP}) using mixed integer semidefinite programming. A non-convex quadratic optimization problem to compute $\alpha_k$ can be formulated as
% 
% \begin{align}\label{QP}
%  \min \quad & \Norm{Ax}{2}^2 \nonumber \\
%  \text{s.t.} \quad & \Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1 \tag{QP} \\
%  & \Norm{x}{0} \leq k. \nonumber
% \end{align}
% 
% By switching $\min$ for $\max$ in (\ref{QP}) we also get a corresponding optimization problem to compute $\beta_k$ and therefore also $\gamma_k$ and $\delta_k$.
% The cardinality-constraint in (\ref{QP}) can equivalently be written using binary variables $z_i$ as $-z_i \leq x_i \leq z_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n z_i \leq k$. For the non-convex quadratic equality constraint $\Norm{x}{2}^2 = 1$ we will
% use the technique of semidefinite lifting first introduced in \cite{GW95} for the max-cut problem. The idea is to use a new matrix variable $X=xx\T$ for the quadratic terms, where the condition $X=xx\T$ is then enforced by the 
% equivalent constraints $X \succeq 0$ and $\Rk(X) = 1$, where $X
% \succeq 0$ means that $X$ is symmetric and positive semidefinite. Using
% that $\Norm{Ax}{2}^2 = x\T A\T Ax = \Tr(A\T A X)$ and 
% $\Tr(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$, we can thus rewrite (\ref{QP}) equivalently to
\begin{align}\label{Rk1MISDP}
 \min \quad & \Tr(A\T A X) \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Tr(X) = 1 \nonumber \\
 & -z_j \leq X_{ij} \leq z_j \quad \text{for } j = 1, ..., n \nonumber \\
 & \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \leq k \tag{M1} \\
 & \Rk(X) = 1 \nonumber \\
 & X \succeq 0  \nonumber \\
 & z \in \{0,1\}^n. \nonumber
\end{align}
The next step would then be to relax the non-convex rank constraint again to arrive at the following relaxation which computes a lower bound on the optimal constant $\alpha_k$ in (\ref{lowerRIP}):
\begin{align}\label{MISDP}
 \min \quad & \Tr(A\T A X) \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Tr(X) = 1 \nonumber \\
 & -z_j \leq X_{ij} \leq z_j \quad \text{for } j = 1, ..., n \nonumber \\
 & \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \leq k \tag{MISDP} \\
 & X \succeq 0  \nonumber \\
 & z \in \{0,1\}^n \nonumber
\end{align}

In the following we will show that (\ref{MISDP}) not only computes a lower bound but the exact value of $\alpha_k$. For this we will use results about the geometry of semidefinite programs to show that there always exists an 
optimal solution to (\ref{MISDP}) with rank 1 so that the optimal objective values of (\ref{Rk1MISDP}) and (\ref{MISDP}) have to agree. We will use the following result by Pataki \cite{pat98} about the relationship between the rank of
solutions of semidefinite programs and the dimension of corresponding faces, meaning a subset $F$ of the convex set $P$ such that \mbox{$x \in F, y, z \in P$} and $x = 0.5y + 0.5z$ imply $y,z \in F$:

\begin{theorem}\label{patakiLemma}
 Let $X \in F$, where $F$ is a face of
 \begin{equation*}
 P \define \{X \in S_n : X \succeq 0, \Tr(A_i X) = b_i \ \text{for } i = 1, ..., m\}
 \end{equation*}
 for symmetric matrices $A_i \in S_n, i \leq m$. Then
 \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{2}\Rk(X)\cdot(\Rk(X)+1) \leq m + dim(F).
 \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

Now we will use this theorem on the projection of the feasible set of (\ref{MISDP}) onto the space of all indices $i$, such that $z_i = 1$ for a given optimal solution of (\ref{MISDP}), to show that there always exists an optimal 
solution to (\ref{MISDP}) with rank one.

\begin{theorem}\label{Rk1thm}
 For every $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ and $k \geq 1$ there exists an optimal solution $X^*, z^*$ to (\ref{MISDP}) such that $\Rk(X^*) = 1$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 Because of the constraint $\Tr(X) = 1$, Problem~\eqref{MISDP} is bounded and $X_{11} = 1, X_{ij} = 0 \ \forall i,j \neq 1,$ \mbox{$z_1 = 1, z_i = 0 \ \forall i \neq 1$} 
 is always feasible for $k > 0$,  so an optimal solution to~\eqref{MISDP} exists.
 Let $\hat{X}, \hat{z}$ be such an optimal solution to (\ref{MISDP}) with $\sum_{i=1}^n z_i =: \ell \leq k$.
 Define
 \begin{align}\label{Proj}
 \min \quad & \Tr(\tilde{A}\T\tilde{A}\tilde{X}) \nonumber \\
 \text{s.t.} \quad & \Tr(\tilde{X}) = 1 \tag{Proj} \\
 & \tilde{X} \succeq 0  \nonumber 
 \end{align}
for $\tilde{X} \in S_\ell$, where $\tilde{A} = (A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, ..., A_{i_\ell})$ consists of those
columns $\{{i_1}, {i_2}, ..., {i_\ell}\} \enifed T$ of $A$ for which
$\hat{z}_{i_k} = 1$.

Now let $\bar{X}$ be the $\ell \times \ell$ submatrix of $\hat{X}$ with all rows and columns outside of $T$ removed. Then $\bar{X}$ is feasible for (\ref{Proj}) with the same objective value as the optimal solution $\hat{X}$ of (\ref{MISDP}), 
as we only removed zero rows and columns of $\hat{X}$ and $(A\T A)\hat{X}$, which do not influence the trace or the positive semidefiniteness.

On the other hand we can lift any optimal solution $\check{X}$ of (\ref{Proj}) to a feasible point for (\ref{MISDP}) with identical objective value by setting $z^{\prime}_i$ to one if and only if $i \in T$
and $X^{\prime}_{i_{j_1} i_{j_2}} = \check{X}_{j_1j_2}$ if and only if $i_{j_1}, i_{j_2} \in T$
and $X^{\prime}_{ij}=0$ otherwise. This solution will then be feasible for (\ref{MISDP}), since $\Tr(\check{X}) = 1$ and $\check{X}\in S_\ell$ imply $0 \leq \check{X}_{jj} = X^{\prime}_{i_j i_j} \leq 1$ and therefore 
$X^{\prime}_{ij} \leq z^{\prime}_j$ by diagonal dominance of semidefinite matrices.

So the optimal objective values of (\ref{Proj}) and (\ref{MISDP}) agree and with this construction also 
$\Rk(X^{\prime}) = \Rk(\check{X})$, so it suffices to show that (\ref{Proj}) always allows for an optimal solution of rank one.
Let $\breve{X}$ be an extreme point of (\ref{Proj}) (as the set of optimal points of (\ref{Proj}) is a non-empty, convex, compact subset of $\R^{\ell(\ell+1)/2}$, such a point exists
\cite[Corollary 18.5.1]{Roc70}) with corresponding face $F=\{\breve{X}\}$. Then using Theorem~\ref{patakiLemma} on (\ref{Proj}) with $\tilde{m} = 1$ LP-constraint gives
\begin{equation*}
 \frac{1}{2}\Rk(\breve{X})\cdot(\Rk(\breve{X})+1) \leq \tilde{m} + dim(F) = 1 + 0 = 1.
\end{equation*}
Since $\breve{X}=0$ is infeasible for $\Tr(X)=1$, we must have $\Rk(\breve{X}) = 1$, which can then be lifted to an optimal solution of (\ref{MISDP}) with rank one.
\end{proof}

Since Theorem~\ref{Rk1thm} guarantees that (\ref{MISDP}) always has a solution of rank one and the rank-constraint was the only constraint we relaxed to get (\ref{MISDP}) from (\ref{QP}), this means that their optimal objective values 
have to agree and we can compute the optimal constant $\alpha_k$ for the RIP by solving (\ref{MISDP}). Since the same argumentation also holds for the maximization problem for $\beta_k$, this allows us to compute the restricted isometry
constant and the restricted isometry ratio by mixed integer semidefinite programming.

\begin{remark}\label{Rk1rmk}
Theorem \ref{Rk1thm} still holds if additional constraints are added fixing some of the binary variables $z_j$ to $0$ or $1$. In this case there will always exist an optimal solution to problem (\ref{MISDP}) with these added
constraints with rank $1$, such that the optimal objective value of this problem will also equal that of (\ref{Rk1MISDP}) with the added constraints. This means in particular, that solving problem (\ref{MISDP}) using a 
branch-and-bound-approach is the same as solving the original problem (\ref{Rk1MISDP}) with a branch-and-bound-code.
\end{remark}

To solve \eqref{MISDP} successfully using a branch-and-bound-approach, it is important to have strong semidefinite relaxations for fractional $z$ variables. 
Therefore we will further strengthen the constraint coupling the continuous and binary variables to force the nonzero entries of $z$ towards one in the
semidefinite relaxations.

\begin{lemma}\label{HalfConstraint} 
The constraint $-z_j \leq X_{ij} \leq z_j$ in~\eqref{MISDP} can be substituted for all non-diagonal entries of $X$ by the stronger constraint 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HalfConstraint}
  -\frac{1}{2}z_j \leq X_{ij} \leq \frac{1}{2}z_j.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ satisfy $\Tr(X)=1$ and $X\succeq 0$. Then $X_{ii}+X_{jj}\leq 1$ and nonnegativity of the diagonal 
entries imply $X_{ii}X_{jj}\leq 1/4$. 
Since all minors of $X$ need to be nonnegative, it follows that
\begin{equation*}
  X_{ij}^2 \leq  X_{ii} X_{jj} \leq \frac{1}{4}
\end{equation*}
and therefore $-1/2 \leq X_{ij} \leq 1/2$, which implies the equivalence between
$-z_j \leq X_{ij} \leq z_j$ and~\eqref{eq:HalfConstraint} for all integer values 
of $z$.
\end{proof}


Theorem \ref{Rk1thm} and Remark \ref{Rk1rmk} do not guarantee that any found solution will have rank one, they only guarantee that there exists a rank one solution. But this is not a problem for applications in the context of the RIP, 
since we are only interested in the optimal objective value, since it implies the constant $\alpha_k$ or $\beta_k$ for the RIP. For other applications like the SPCA such an extreme solution can also be generated with an algorithm 
proposed by Pataki in \cite{coneLP}.

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical_results}

In this section we want to show the applicability of our proposed MISDP-formulation and use it to
assess the quality of the relaxations proposed in \cite{Asp08} and \cite{Asp07}.
For solving the mixed-integer semidefinite programs we use the MISDP-Solver SCIP-SDP \cite{SCIP-SDP} 
originally developed in \cite{Mar13} and \cite{MS12}, which combines the branch-and-bound-framework of SCIP 3.2.1 \cite{SCIP} with 
interior-point SDP-solvers, in our case SDPA~7.3.8~\cite{SDPA6,SDPA7}. The continuous SDPs are solved using the command-line version of 
SDPA~7.3.8. In our tests we compute the left- and right-hand restricted isometry constant 
$\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ either exactly using~\eqref{MISDP} or produce corresponding bounds via (\ref{Asp07}) and (\ref{Asp08Dual}). In the latter case we solve 15 
SDPs for $\rho$ between $0$ and the maximum diagonal entry of $A\T A$. 

The testset consists of 63 matrices of seven 
different types including band matrices 
with band size three or five with entries within the band chosen uniformly in $\{0,1\}$, binary matrices with all entries chosen 
uniformly in $\{0,1\}$, Gaussian-distributed matrices and rank one 
matrices $A = aa\T$ with $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$-distributed entries of $a$. In addition to these four kinds of matrices, 
we also use three more with theoretical results about their restricted isometry constants, namely matrices with 
$N(0, 1/m)$-distributed entries, with entries chosen uniformly in $\pm 1/\sqrt{m}$ and finally with distribution
\begin{equation}\nonumber
A_{ij} = \begin{cases} + \sqrt{3/m} & \text{with probability } \frac{1}{6} \\ 0 & \text{with probability } \frac{2}{3} \\ - \sqrt{3/m} & \text{with probability } \frac{1}{6}. \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For the latter three kinds of matrices it is shown in \cite{BDDW08} that for $n \rightarrow \infty$, 
sufficiently small $k$ and given $\delta$, they satisfy the restricted isometry property (\ref{rip}) of order $k$  
with probability converging exponentially to one. The needed proportion between $n$ and $k$ is so small, however,
that we cannot expect the generated matrices in small dimensions to satisfy the RIP. For each type we used \mbox{MATLAB 8.3.0} 
to randomly generate nine matrices of three different sizes with rows ranging from 15 to 30, columns 
from 25 to 40 and order $k$ between three and five.

The tests were performed on a Linux cluster with Intel i3 CPUs with 3.2GHz, 4MB cache and 8GB memory running
Linux. Each computation was performed single-threaded with a single process running on each computer and with 
a time limit of four hours. The code was compiled with gcc 4.4.5 with \texttt{-O3} optimization. For the 
Problem~\eqref{Asp08Dual} most of the larger instance were aborted because of the memory limit, these are
counted with the maximum allowed time of four hours. 

In Table~\ref{lhsGap} we compare the relative gap between the bounds on $\alpha_k$ computed by the two heuristics
and the exact values given by our
mixed integer semidefinite program. We give arithmetic means over all of the nine matrices for the given type that
could be solved within the time- and memory-limit. Note that we ommitted the rank one matrices, since these satisfy
$\alpha_k = 0$ in all cases, so that the trivial lower bound would already be optimal. For the 
left-hand-side of the RIP, both relaxations did not perform
too well. Especially the relaxation given in \cite{Asp08} regularly returned worse solutions than the
trivial lower bound of zero. The relaxation in \cite{Asp07} performed slightly better, but the bounds
were still not nearly good enough to have any chance of proving $\ell_0$-$\ell_1$-equivalance. The relatively
bad performance of both relaxations for the left-hand side might not be too surprising, since both relaxations
were originally designed for sparse principal component analysis, which corresponds to the right-hand side
of the RIP.

\input{tables/lhsGap}

Results for the right-hand side, i.e. $\beta_k$, are given in Table~\ref{rhsGap}. Here both relaxations
perform much better. Problem~\eqref{Asp08Dual} constantly produces bounds within 10 to 35\,\% of the optimal
solution. The formulation in~\eqref{Asp08Dual} shows bigger fluctuation, but is very tight in many cases,
with a gap of less than two percent for band matrices.

\input{tables/rhsGap}

Solving times for the left- and right-hand side are given in Table~\ref{lhsTime} and~\ref{rhsTime}. The relaxation proposed in \cite{Asp07}
is very fast, taking only a few seconds for all instances. The mixed-integer semidefinite program obviously
cannot compete with these solving times, although for band-matrices, specifically, the difference is relatively
small. The Lagrangian Relaxation from \cite{Asp08}, however, takes more time to produce bounds than is needed
by our MISDP to compute exact solutions. The big difference is also caused by the instances running into the 
memory limit, but even without those, the algorithm still takes slightly longer than the MISDP.

\section{Conclusion}

We have seen that exact restricted isometry constants can be computed not only via total enumeration but also by solving a mixed integer semidefinite program. Because of this exactness result, the new problem can drastically
improve the bounds computed by the semidefinite relaxations proposed in \cite{Asp08} and \cite{Asp07}, but this comes at the cost of a much higher complexity of computation, at least in comparison to \cite{Asp07}. We could only 
solve these problems for relatively small instances, but this might change with sufficient advances in the area of mixed integer semidefinite programming, especially with the addition of special cutting planes, which proved to be 
the main enhancement needed to make mixed integer linear solvers as fast as they are today. Also special heuristics and branching rules could improve the performance of the branch-and-bound-algorithm and allow us to solve bigger 
instances of the proposed MISDP.
