/**@mainpage Overview
 *
 * @version 2.1.0
 * @author Tristan Gally, Marc Pfetsch; Sonja Mars, Lars Schewe
 * @date 2011-2016
 *
 * SCIP-SDP is a plugin for SCIP to solve mixed integer semidefinite programs (MISDPs). It combines the branch-and-bound
 * framework of SCIP with interior-point SDP-solvers. It provides the data handling, some presolving and propagation as
 * well as a reader for a modified sparse SDPA-format with additional lines for integrality constraints (see 
 * data_format.txt). It is possible to solve the resulting SDP-relaxations using a linear approximation procedure, but for
 * full functionality one of the following SDP-solvers needs to be installed:
 *
 * - DSDP
 * - SDPA
 *
 * The solution process of interior-point methods for SDPs is highly dependent on the Slater condition. One of the main
 * purposes of the code is ensuring that the slater condition is not harmed by fixing variables in the branch-and-bound
 * process. However in some cases the combination of variable fixings and specific linear or semidefinite constraints might
 * still lead to relaxations for which the Slater condition no longer holds. In this case the SDP-solvers may be unable to
 * solve the relaxations or even return wrong results, which cannot be compensated. For this purpose there is the 
 * possibility to check the Slater condition for the primal and dual problem before the solution of each SDP by setting a 
 * SCIP parameter, for details see the parameters tab.
