 *
 * SCIP-SDP is a plugin for SCIP to solve mixed integer semidefinite programs (MISDPs) of the form
 *
 *   \f{equation*}{
 * 	\begin{aligned}
 *      \inf \quad & b^T y && \\
 *      \mbox{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{i = 1}^m A_i y_i - A_0 \succeq 0,&& \\
 *	& y_i \in \mathbb{Z} && \forall \ i \in \mathcal{I}.
 *	\end{aligned}
 *   \f}
 *
 * It combines the branch-and-bound framework of SCIP with interior-point SDP-solvers to solve MISDPs using either a
 * nonlinear branch-and-bound approach or an outer-approximation-based cutting-plane approach. In addition to providing
 * a constraint handler for SDP-constraints and a relaxator to solve continuous SDP-relaxations using interior-point
 * solvers, SCIPSDP adds several heuristics and propagators to SCIP. The MISDPs can be read in using either an extended
 * SDPA-format or the CBF-format. To use the nonlinear branch-and-bound approach one of the following SDP-solvers needs
 * to be installed:
 *
 * - DSDP
 * - SDPA
 * - MOSEK
 *
 * The solution process of interior-point methods for SDPs is highly dependent on the Slater condition. One of the main
 * purposes of the code is handling cases where the Slater condition does not hold using a penalty approach. However, in
 * some cases the SDP-solvers may still fail because of numerical difficulties or even return wrong results, which cannot
 * be compensated. For this purpose there is the possibility to check the Slater condition for the primal and dual problem
 * before the solution of each SDP by setting a SCIP parameter, for details see the parameters tab.
