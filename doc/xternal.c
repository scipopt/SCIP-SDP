 *
 * SCIP-SDP is a plugin for SCIP to solve mixed integer semidefinite programs (MISDPs) of the form
 *
 *   \f{equation*}{
 * 	\begin{aligned}
 *      \inf \quad & b^T y && \\
 *      \mbox{s.t.} \quad & \sum_{i = 1}^m A_i y_i - A_0 \succeq 0,&& \\
 *	& y_i \in \mathbb{Z} && \forall \ i \in \mathcal{I}.
 *	\end{aligned}
 *   \f}
 *
 * SCIP-SDP allows to solve MISDPs using a nonlinear branch-and-bound approach or a linear programming cutting-plane
 * approach. In the first case (the default), the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are solve using
 * interior-point SDP-solvers. In the second case, cutting planes based on eigenvector are generated.  SCIP-SDP is based
 * on the branch-and-cut framework <A HREF="https://scipopt.org">SCIP</A>.  In addition to providing a constraint
 * handler for SDP-constraints and a relaxator to solve continuous SDP-relaxations using interior-point solvers,
 * SCIP-SDP adds several heuristics and propagators to SCIP.
 *
 * The MISDPs can be read in using either an extended SDPA-format or the CBF-format. There is also an interface for
 * Matlab/Octave on <A HREF="https://github.com/scipopt/MatlabSCIPInterface">GitHub</A>.
 *
 * To use the nonlinear branch-and-bound approach one of the following SDP-solvers needs to be installed:
 *
 * - DSDP
 * - SDPA
 * - MOSEK
 *
 * Mixed-integer semidefinite programs are sometimes numerically challenging to solve. One reason is that the Slater
 * condition may not hold for the SDP-relaxations of some of the nodes. SCIP-SDP implements several methods that try to
 * recover from a failure to accurately solve the relaxation.
