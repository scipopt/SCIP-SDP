 * @author Sonja Mars, Lars Schewe, Tristan Gally, Marc Pfetsch
 * @date 2011-2015
 *
 * The SCIP-SDP-Package is a plug-in for the Software SCIP. It is able to solve Mixed-Integer SDPs using the
 * interior-point solver DSDP and SCIP as a branch and bound framework. It provides a lot of data handling, some
 * presolve routines and an linear approximation procedure for MISDPs. Two examples for mixed-integer semidefinite
 * programs are arising from truss topology design and maximum cut problems on graphs. We tested our code on a lot of
 * instances, most of them are trusses or max-cuts.
