SCIP-SDP version 2.0
==================

fixed bugs:
- if DSDP didn't converge but produced primal and dual feasible solutions, these are no longer automatically accepted but are checked for optimality

data structures:

features:

performance improvements:

interface:
- added a more modular SDP-Interface and removed direct DSDP-reverences from the SCIPSDP-core-code
- added interface to SDPA

parameters:

core:
- bounds from SCIP are no longer transformed into LP-rows but are given to the SDP Solver as bounds

Makefile:
- creates extra directory sdpi for SDP-Interface

misc:




SCIP-SDP version 1.1
==================

fixed bugs:
- input-file may now have comment-lines between LP-block-lines
- value 0 in the last LP-block-line no longer causes an infinite loop
- friends-declaration in BlockMemoryAllocator.cpp
- added missing cassert to SDPSolverFactory.cpp
- added missing newlines at the end of BlockMemoryAllocator.h and config.h

data structures:

parameters:
- in standard configuration SDP-Relaxations are now called instead of Eigenvalue-Cuts

core:
