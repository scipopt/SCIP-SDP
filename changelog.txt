SCIP-SDP version 2.0
==================

fixed bugs:
- if DSDP does not converge but produces primal and dual feasible solutions, these are no longer accepted as optimal
- reader no longer crashes because of comment-lines between SDP/LP-block-lines
- value 0 in the last LP-block-line no longer causes an infinite loop
- non-numbers in the SDP/LP-block-lines and lines with more or less than five entries no longer cause infinite loops
  or get cut off or combined with others rows, but cause exits with meaningful error messages
- removed the diagDominant-cuts that are only correct for general MISDPs under some prerequisites

data structures:
- now uses arrays for the nonzeros instead of the SDP-cone class

features:
- dual/reduced cost fixing for SDPs
- added branching rules, as some of the SCIP branching rules only work on LP-solutions

performance improvements:

interface:
- added a more modular SDP-Interface and removed direct DSDP-references from the SCIPSDP-core-code
- added beta version of interface to SDPA

parameters:
- can now specify epsilon and feasibility tolerance for the SDP-solver specifically
- can specify whether an objective limit should be set for the SDP-solver
- can choose to display output of SDP-solver
- can choose to check slater condition in the dual problem ahead of solving the SDPs
- for a full list check the parameters tab in the documentation

core:
- transferred all code except for reader and SDPA-interface from C++ to C
- now uses the SCIP shell
- added SCIP 3.2.0 support
- bounds from SCIP are no longer transformed into LP-rows but are given to the SDP Solver (specifically DSDP, for SDPA 
  they still need to be transformed) as bounds

Makefile:
- creates extra directory sdpi for SDP-Interface
- SDP-solver is now specified via make option SDPS=...
- links are now set via console when calling make instead of the make.local file

misc:
- total and average SDP-iterations are displayed in the shell
