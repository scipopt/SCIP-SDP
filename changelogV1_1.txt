SCIP-SDP version 1.1
==================

fixed bugs:
- input-file may now have comment-lines between LP-block-lines and also between the variable and block definitions
- value 0 in the last LP-block-line no longer causes an infinite loop
- friends-declaration in BlockMemoryAllocator.cpp
- added missing cassert to SDPSolverFactory.cpp
- added missing newlines at the end of BlockMemoryAllocator.h and config.h
- if DSDP didn't converge but produced primal and dual feasible solutions, these are no longe automatically accepted but are checked for optimality

data structures:
- added a new SDP-Interface-structure and replaced the DsdpInterface by sdpi_dsdp

features:

performance improvements:

interface:

parameters:
- in standard configuration SDP-Relaxations are now called instead of Eigenvalue-Cuts

core:
- added SCIP 3.1.0 support by adding an additional parameter to SCIPaddCut
- in the old version, if DSDP had problems while solving, DSDP was called again with a penalty-only-formulation, if this showed, that the problem is feasible, the relaxation from the parent-node was copied, now DSDP is called again with a penalty formulation that also includes the real objective in the hope solve the relaxation with a more stable approach

Makefile:
- SCIP-SDP is now started via ./bin/scipsdp instead of ./bin/main
- additional option of SDPS=dsdp when calling make instead of $(USE_DSDP) = true

misc:
- added Doxygen-Documentation
