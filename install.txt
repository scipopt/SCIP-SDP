SDP-Plugin for SCIP

Install-instructions
=====================

Additional Software (SCIP and DSDP)
------------------------------------
For using the SDP-Plugin for SCIP you need a installed and fully working version
of SCIP 3.1 (http://scip.zib.de/) or higher. Additionally you need to install 
DSDP 5.8 (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/hs/software/DSDP/).

Build SDP-Plugin
----------------
Now you are able to install the SDP-Plugin. It uses the SCIP-Makefiles for 
building. After unpacking the files you just have to change the file make.local to
set your DSDP directory and set the variable SCIPDIR to the place of your SCIP-directoy.
In the file make.project.override you can set additional options, for example 
you can change the compiler using
CC=clang
CXX=clang++

Now you just enter the directory and use
 
make SDPS=dsdp

and everything should be built. The executable can be found in the bin 
directory. In addition to SDPS you can use the same options for the Makefile 
as you can use building SCIP (i.e. make OPT=dbg, LPS=cpx), you may also create
a doxygen-documentation by calling i.e. make OPT=dbg SDPS=dsdp doc

You can now use the SDP-Plugin by calling

./bin/scipsdp

to open a SCIP shell for solving MISDPs. You can now read a SDPA-File with added
integrality constraints (for details about the format see data_format.txt) named 
instancefile.dat-s by calling

read instancefile.dat-s

followed by 

optimize

as in the usual SCIP shell. Additionally you can define scip-parameters in a 
parameterfile or via the shell. How to define parameters is described on the 
scip-website. The most important new parameters are 
_________________________
lp/solvefreq=-1 
relaxing/SDP/freq=1
-------------------------

The first one tells scip how often LPs are solved, using eigenvectore-cuts to 
produce a positive semidefinite solution. -1 means never, 0 solves a
LP-relaxation only in the root node, 1 solves it in every node and every other 
positive integer defines the depth in which LPs are solved.The same numbers can 
be used for definig the SDP-solving-frequency, which is the second parameter.
Default, SDPs are solved in every node and LPs never.
